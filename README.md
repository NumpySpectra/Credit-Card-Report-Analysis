# Credit Card Report Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions using **PostgreSQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights regarding spending patterns, fraud detection, and customer behavior.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage and complex queries
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV**: Data source

## 📂 Project Files
- **Credit Card Financial Dashboard-Customer.pdf**: Report on customer insights from the credit card financial dashboard.
- **Credit Card Financial Dashboard-Transaction.pdf**: Report on transaction-based analysis in the credit card financial dashboard.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
- **SQL Query - Financial Dashboard Data.sql**: SQL queries for extracting and analyzing financial data.
- **cc_add.csv**: Dataset containing credit card additional details.
- **credit_card.csv**: Main dataset containing credit card transactions.
- **cust_add.csv**: Additional customer data.
- **customer.csv**: Customer details dataset.

## 📊 Key Features
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using PostgreSQL.
- Fraud detection insights using SQL queries.
- Customer segmentation based on spending patterns.
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization.
- Trend analysis of credit card usage.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details
- **Transaction Data**: Transaction ID, Date, Amount, Merchant, Location, Category, Customer ID.
- **Customer Data**: Customer ID, Name, Demographics, Credit Score.
- **Fraud Indicator**: Identifies potential fraudulent transactions.

## 📌 Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Importing credit card transaction data into PostgreSQL.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.
3. **SQL Analysis**: Writing queries for trend analysis and fraud detection.
4. **Visualization in Power BI**: Creating dashboards with insights on spending patterns, fraud trends, and customer segmentation.
5. **Insights & Conclusion**: Deriving key takeaways from the analysis.


 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Import the dataset into **PostgreSQL**.
2. Run the SQL queries provided in the `SQL Query - Financial Dashboard Data.sql` file.
3. Load the cleaned data into **Power BI**.
4. Use the Power BI file (`.pbix`) to explore the visualizations.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implementing **machine learning** models for fraud detection.
- Integrating real-time data updates.
- Automating report generation.
